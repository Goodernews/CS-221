# HW 8: Huffman

**By:** Taylor Blair & Alan Jessup

# Part One

Implementing Huffman encoding.

- [ ] Structure Outlined
- [ ] Code written
- [ ] Compiling successfully
- [ ] Passing all tests
- [ ] No memory leaks

## `huffman.hh`

Header file

## `huffman.cc`

Functions

## `test_huffman.cc`

Testing time!

1. Makes vla vla
2. Snack break! Time for computer chips.

# Part Two

Creating a bitio class that reads and writes bits.

- [ ] Structure Outlined
- [ ] Code written
- [ ] Compiling successfully
- [ ] Passing all tests
- [ ] No memory leaks


## `bitio.hh`

Header file

## `bitio.cc`

What are the functions


## `test_bitio.cc`

1. test patience
2. Take the elevator out of the bit mine

# Part Three

Lets encode and decode!

- [ ] Structure Outlined
- [ ] Code written
- [ ] Compiling successfully
- [ ] Passing all tests
- [ ] No memory leaks


## `encoder.cc`

Takes a file, and compresses. Outputs a `.comp` file

## `decoder.cc`

Takes a `.comp` outputs a `.comp.plaintext`


# Part Four

Middle out test

| File |  Original File Size | Compressed Size | Same size post decompression? |
| ---- | ------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Listrada| all of the bytes | fits in an overhead bin | Ehhhhhhh              |
